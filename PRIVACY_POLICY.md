# Privacy Policy for Salesforce Default Page Extension

**Last updated:** June 2025

## Overview
The Salesforce Default Page Extension is a browser extension that helps users set a custom default page when logging into Salesforce. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data.

## Data Collection
This extension:
- **Does NOT collect any personal information**
- **Does NOT track your browsing history**
- **Does NOT send data to external servers**
- **Does NOT store any Salesforce data**

## Data Storage
The extension only stores:
- Your preferred default page setting (locally in your browser)
- Whether the extension is enabled/disabled (locally in your browser)
- Theme preference (light/dark mode) (locally in your browser)

All data is stored locally using Chrome's storage API and is never transmitted to any external servers.

## Permissions Used
- **activeTab**: Required to interact with Salesforce pages
- **storage**: Required to save your preferences locally
- **host_permissions**: Limited to Salesforce domains only (*.salesforce.com, *.force.com, *.lightning.force.com, *.my.salesforce.com)

## How It Works
1. The extension runs only on Salesforce domains
2. It detects when you log into Salesforce
3. It redirects you to your preferred page instead of the default home page
4. All processing happens locally in your browser

## Third-Party Services
This extension does not use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools.

## Updates
This privacy policy may be updated occasionally. The version number in the extension will indicate when changes are made.

## Contact
If you have questions about this privacy policy, please review the extension's source code or contact the developer through the Chrome Web Store listing.

## Compliance
This extension complies with:
- Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requirements
